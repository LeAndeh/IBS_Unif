# IBS_Unif
IBS (ion beam sputtering) program to calculate uniformity using Scilab 6.0

What I needed to do:
1) Define a fixed sputtering source. Later, get scilab to calculate x sputtering sources based on variables from the ion source.
=>fixed sputtering source complete, attemping the all sources to target plate.

2) calculate the material coming to any point of the wafer:
- know both the distance between the source and the point on the wafer / substrate,
- know the angle between the normal of the source and the point on the wafer.
=> this is complete

3) add substrate rotation
=> not yet implemented
